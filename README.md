## 🚀 What I Do

As a **Senior Frontend Engineer** passionate about the future of the web, I specialize in building **intelligent**, **scalable**, and **decentralized** user interfaces. From enterprise-grade legal tech dashboards to real-time blockchain visualizations, I design and ship **production-ready UIs** that solve real-world problems.

- 🔗 Develop full-stack Web3 dApps with Solidity, Hardhat, IPFS, and The Graph
- ⚛️ Architect frontend systems with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- 🔄 Build reusable, modular React component libraries with state management using Redux, Zustand, or React Query
- 📱 Optimize React performance using memoization, lazy loading, and efficient rendering strategies
- 📦 Design scalable APIs and backend services using Node.js, Express, and NestJS
- ⚙️ Integrate RESTful and GraphQL APIs with Apollo Client, React Query, and efficient data caching mechanisms
- 🔄 Implement server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) using Next.js to enhance SEO and load performance
- 🧩 Manage authentication, session handling, and user permissions securely with JWT, OAuth, and Passport.js
- 🧱 Establish CI/CD pipelines, unit and integration testing with Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress
- 🌍 Craft data-rich interfaces for AI, semantic search, and real-time collaboration
- 🔐 Prioritize security, scalability, accessibility, and performance in all builds
- 🧠 Lead frontend teams, mentor engineers, and set up CI/CD, testing, and scalable state management
- 🚀 Implement microservices architecture and serverless functions using AWS Lambda, Vercel, or Cloudflare Workers
- 📊 Monitor app performance with tools like Sentry, Datadog, and New Relic, and resolve bottlenecks proactively
